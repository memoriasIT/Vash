# Introduction

Vash is a shell with <b>Vim-like capabilities</b>.

It does achieve all (and even more!) that Vim provides to you; use
<b>modes, macros, autocompletion, etc.</b> while executing your favorite 
commands.

Just like vim, it is highly configurable; so all hotkeys and general
config can be changed easily.

Vash is currently in alpha, contributions will be open in beta stage.
